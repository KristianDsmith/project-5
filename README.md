## UX

I have had a very tight time constraint with only 4 weeks to complete this project as well as follow the walk-along project, Boutique Ado. I took the decision to base the webshop on the walk-along project, Boutique Ado. I have used high-quality images of products from friends and from past projects, which I feel gives the consumer a real visualization of quality within the site and products.
