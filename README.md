## About

Roundhouse Records is a e-commerce website that allows customers to buy music products (vinyl) and streetwear clothing online. It has login system, a shopping cart, a checkout system, and payment system. Customers can write reviews and rate products. Also customers are able to listen to the music before purchasing through links spavined on Spotify. Customers are able to add products to their wish slit for purchase at a later date. The website allows the store owner to update and edit products and also delete products when sold out.

## UX

I have had a very tight time constraint with only 4 weeks to complete this project as well as follow the walk-along project, Boutique Ado. I took the decision to base the webshop on the walk-along project, Boutique Ado. I have used high-quality images of products from friends and from past projects, which I feel gives the consumer a real visualization of quality within the site and products.
